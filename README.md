## My process
1. First I wrote the HTML for the site in index.html, starting with the rating component 
2. I then wrote out some basic styling to get layout.css going
3. From here I worked on getting the number clicked on to show the right styles
4. Then I started applying the functionality for rendering the "Thank You" component
5. Once I got the "Thank You" component mostly working I fixed up the styles for it
6. Lastly, I worked on getting the components to render properly for mobile devices

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JQuery

### What I learned

- Working with jQuery was fun, but challenging
- Responsive design takes time to perfect

### Continued development

I definitely want to focus on becoming better at responsive designs. Any tips are greatly appreciated!
